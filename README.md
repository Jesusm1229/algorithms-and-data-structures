# Algorithms & Data Structures
> Algorithms & Data Structures implemented in and explained with JavaScript.

The idea originates from my [Twitter series](https://twitter.com/oliverjumpertz/status/1291055493595705348) with the same name.

## Data Structures currently covered
- [Array](./data_structures/array/README.md)
- [ArrayList](./data_structures/array_list/README.md)
- [(Doubly) Linked List](./data_structures/linked_list/README.md)

## Usage
Within the folder `data_structures` you'll find sub folders containing individual data structures.

Each folder comes with its own README that contains images and further explanations, as well as the JavaScript implementations of each data structure as well as a selected few algorithms.

To get started, if you want to play around with this, do a `yarn install` first, to download the dependencies necessary to run the code and the associated tests.

## Progress
Still in the progress of smoothening things and migrating everything over to this repository.
