# Algorithms & Data Structures
> Algorithms & Data Structures implemented in and explained with JavaScript.

The idea originates from my [Twitter series](https://twitter.com/oliverjumpertz/status/1291055493595705348) with the same name.

## Data Structures currently covered
- [Array](./data_structures/array/README.md)

## Progress
Still in the progress of smoothening things and migrating everything over to this repository.
